# RestApiRefProject
This is a reference project illustrating many examples of what a production API should implement.

- The minimal_api branch contains an example using the minimal API approach (which I think I prefer).
- Next steps:
  - Add an EF Core backend
  - Add Redis
  - Add unit tests
  - Add OpenTelemetry
  - Add Docker
